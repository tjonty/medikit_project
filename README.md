# Medikit ü©∫  
**Your Health, Centralized and Accessible**  

## Current Status ‚è≥  
Medikit was deployed on Heroku but is now archived due to Heroku‚Äôs free tier discontinuation. The source code and screenshots remain available, demonstrating my ability to build practical, impactful applications.

## About Medikit üè•  
Medikit is a Django-based web application designed to centralize patients‚Äô medical data, offering a single gateway for doctors, pathologists, and patients to manage and access health information. Doctors and pathologists can upload prescriptions, medication details, and pathology results, which patients can later view to better understand their health history. Previously live on Heroku, Medikit is now archived due to Heroku ending its free tier, but it remains a standout project in my portfolio for its real-world utility and technical sophistication.

### Why It Matters üí°  
- **Centralized Records**: Consolidates prescriptions, medications, and test results in one secure place.  
- **Improved Care**: Enables doctors to make informed decisions with access to past treatment data.  
- **Health Education**: Features an articles section for doctors and authors to share insights.  
- **Professional Directory**: Connects users with doctors, pathologists, and hospitals.  
- **Secure & User-Friendly**: Prioritizes privacy and ease of use for all stakeholders.  

## Motivation üí™  
Patients often struggle to recall their treatment history, and without this information, doctors may lack critical context about past medications, adverse effects, or conditions. Medikit addresses this by providing a simple, secure online platform to store and retrieve medical data, enhancing treatment accuracy and patient outcomes.

## Features üìã  
- **Record Management**: Upload, store, view, and edit medical records online.  
- **Health Articles**: Doctors and authors can publish articles to improve health literacy.  
- **Directory**: Searchable list of doctors, pathologists, and hospitals.  
- **Secure Access**: Role-based authentication for patients, doctors, and pathologists.  
- **Email Notifications**: Alerts for uploads and updates via SendGrid integration.
