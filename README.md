## Medikit
Medikit offers a single gateway for patients' previous treatments, which includes sections for doctors and pathologists. Patients' prescriptions, medication 
information, and pathology results may all be added by doctors and pathologists. Patients and doctors can use this information later to better comprehend the 
patient's condition.

## Motivation 💪
It's difficult for patients to remember all of their previous treatment information, and without it, doctors can't precisely heal him based on previous medication
adverse effects and other critical aspects. As a result, Medikit assists in resolving this issue by transferring all data storage on the internet in a simple manner.
